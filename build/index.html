		<p>Working with Cocoa APIs in Swift is a mostly pleasant experience, even more so with the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=22">upcoming Objective-C changes</a> to express nullability.</p>

<p>There's one case that really irks me though:</p>

		<p>A friend recently gave me a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXTstation">NeXTstation</a> (c. 1991) that he didn't want to take with him on his move across the country. In the decade since the computer was last used, he misplaced the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-subminiature">DB-19</a> display cable. These cables are very hard to come by two decades...</p>

During the mid-2000s, there was a small community of young developers building third-party chat clients for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle.net">Battle.net</a> gaming and matchmaking service. The most famous of these clients, <a href="http://www.stealthbot.net/wiki/StealthBot">StealthBot</a>, was developed right here in Madison, WI.</p>

		</h2>
		<p>When Apple announced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)">Swift</a> one of the first things I heard was "hey, they copied <em>feature</em> from <em>language</em>!" Wikipedia lists Objective-C, Rust, Haskell, Ruby, Python, C#, and CLU as the language's influencers, so it's not surprising that everyone sees something from their favorite language.</p>

<p>Let's take a look at various code samples in different languages and see how they compare to Swift.</p>

		</h2>
		<p>When I decided to start this project I knew I needed a way to easily write articles and view them locally. Since static websites are the latest craze, and can be hosted almost anywhere, I did a bit of searching and found the <a href="https://github.com/middleman/middleman-blog">blog</a> extension for <a href="http://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a>. I also found a guide on running <a href="http://randomerrata.com/post/56163474367/middleman-on-heroku">Middleman on Heroku</a>. I decided that since I'm already managing my blog with Git, I might as well post the whole thing <a href="https://github.com/wjlafrance/blog">on Github</a> so you can see my configuration.</p>

		</h2>
		<p>Hello again, everyone!</p>

<p>I was recently introduced to <a href="http://audiob.us/">Audiobus</a>, a system for inter-app audio on iOS. You can configure various inputs, outputs, and filters in between, much like a musician has their guitar and amplifier with effects boxes. The app costs $5. I wanted to see if I could use it to replace my guitar setup, which is a few cheap ($30-$40) effects pedals and a Marshall practice amp I bought for $10 and fixed.</p>

		<p>If you’re reading this blog, you probably know that I’m a graduate of <a href="http://madisoncollege.edu">Madison Area Technical College</a>’s <a href="http://madisoncollege.edu/files/program-sheets/it-iphone-applications-development-certificate.pdf">iOS development program</a>. I’ve completed the final course in the series as both a student and an auditor, and I am taking the class again, this time again as a student. This means that I will be completing the assignments and in-class activities, and will receive a grade that will go on my college transcript (though as a working professional, that’s probably not of much consequence anymore).</p>

		<p>In Dave Koziol’s iOS Debugging session at <a href="http://cocoaconf.com">CocoaConf</a>, he pointed out that the iOS Simulator does not have a case sensitive file system. As the actual device does have a case sensitive file system, this allows bugs to enter your application unnoticed.</p>
